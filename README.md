>**WARNING! This is not the official branch, and lots of things are going on here. Use this at your own risk.**

nds4droid is a free (including ad-free) open source Nintendo DS emulator for Android smartphones. You can find it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid&hl=en). Do not try to install this on iOS because iOS does not accept or understand anything written in Java.

All releases from [jquesnelle](https://github.com/jquesnelle) will come from him. All releases from this fork can be found in the releases tab.

This emulator uses the [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org) 0.9.10 threaded interpreter (which is old), but also uses Lightning JIT if you want faster performance. Support for 64-bit devices will be available soon (although I doubt that's needed, regardless of performance).

### Issues

If you found an issue, please [make an issue ticket here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/nds4droid/issues/new). Your issue will be closed if it either:
* Has nothing to do with this emulator,
* Contains copyrighted stuff,
* or has something to do with adding support for unsupported devices.

### To-do list

* Increase performance overall.
* Upgrade to DeSmuME 0.9.12.
* Update libraries to the latest version (if applicable).
