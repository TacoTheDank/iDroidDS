# nds4droid

>**WARNING! This is not the official branch, and lots of things are going on here. Use this at your own risk.**

nds4droid is a free (including ad-free) open source Nintendo DS emulator for Android smartphones. You can find it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid&hl=en). Do not try to install this on iOS because iOS does not accept or understand anything written in Java.

All releases from [jquesnelle](https://github.com/jquesnelle) will come from him. All releases from this fork is not uploaded to the play store, but can be found in the releases section of this fork. APKs will be uploaded to the release section of this fork if I believe I need to.
