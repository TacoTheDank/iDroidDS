# nds4droid

>**WARNING! This is not the official branch, and lots of things are going on here. Use this at your own risk.**

nds4droid is a free (including ad-free) open source Nintendo DS emulator for Android smartphones. You can find it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid&hl=en). Do not try to install this on iOS because iOS does not accept or understand anything written in Java.

All releases from [jquesnelle](https://github.com/jquesnelle) will come from him. All releases from this fork is not uploaded to the play store, but can be found in the releases section of this fork. APKs will be uploaded to the release section of this fork if I believe I need to.

This branch contains version 48 in active development. As stated in the warning at the top of this file, use this at your own risk.

This emulator uses the [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org) 0.9.8 threaded interpreter (which is old), but also uses Lightning JIT if you want faster performance. Soon, it will be upgraded to 0.9.11 to handle many issues that were solved between those versions.

### Compatibility

Any Android device running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) will work with this app. However, the device must have:
* Support for OpenGL ES 2.0 or greater.
* 512 MB of RAM.

### Issues

If you found an issue, please [make an issue ticket here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/nds4droid/issues/new). Your issue will be closed if it either:
* Has nothing to do with this emulator,
* Contains copyrighted stuff,
* or has something to do with adding support for unsupported devices.

### To-do list

* Update Lightning JIT 1.2 (2004) to 2.1.0 (2015).
* Upgrade to DeSmuME 0.9.11.
* Update libraries to the latest version (if applicable).
